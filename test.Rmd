# Motivation

This year, a report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that Americaâ€™s obesity rate has reached a record high. In contrast to the popular belief, New Yorkers are not so safe from the obesity epidemic, as more than half of adult New Yorkers are either overweight or obese. Studies show that the rise in the obesity epidemic is partly due to disparities in food environment; it is harder for some to eat healthier because their options are limited.
